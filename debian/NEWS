blender (2.53-beta-svn30596-1) experimental; urgency=low
  Important changes in this upload:
     - /usr/bin/blender is no longer a shell wrapper for
       /usr/bin/blender-bin, it's now the real binary.
     - Rationale: maintaining a bunch of symlinks (from ~/.blender to the
       scripts directories under /usr/share/blender…) was really a mess,
       let's just forget about this. Having some sort of search path
       really is the way to go.
     - The patch tweaking the temporary directory has been dropped for
       now, so one probably should be warned about possible race
       conditions in /tmp. Maybe that's going to be fixed upstream some
       day; in the meanwhile, that's an upload to experimental…
     - Localization seems not to be working (see changelog).

  There is now a script that provide a thumbnail for .blend file with nautilus.
  It is located in /usr/lib/blender/2.53/scripts/blender-thumbnailer.py
  Quote from the script:
  "" Thumbnailer runs with python 2.6 and 3.x.
     To run automatically with nautilus:
       gconftool --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-blender/enable true
       gconftool --type string --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-blender/command "/usr/lib/blender/2.53/scripts/blender-thumbnailer.py %i %o"
  ""
